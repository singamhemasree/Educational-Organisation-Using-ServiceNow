Educational Organisation Using ServiceNow
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on digitizing and streamlining student admissions and academic record management using the ServiceNow Platform. Many educational institutions still rely on manual or disconnected systems to manage admissions, student details, and progress tracking. This often results in errors, delays, and difficulty in maintaining accurate records.
The goal of this project is to build a unified, automated solution that improves efficiency, accuracy, and transparency across the entire student lifecycle.
